## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
 for and while loops use a condition expression to control how many times the loop will execute.
 The condition expression is a Boolean expression that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the expression evaluates to true, the loop will continue to execute. If it evaluates to false, the loop will terminate.
- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?

let i = 0 is the first expression and evaluates first.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
 i = number ;
 the condition expression in a for loop is evaluated before each iteration of the loop in order to
 to determine whether the loop should continue or terminate.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?

i++/i-- is final expression and evaluates last.
It is evaluated at the end of each iteration of the loop, after the loop body has been executed.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
The final expression is typically used to update the loop variable, but it can also be used for other purposes, such as to perform a final check or to execute a statement at the end of each loop iteration.


- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
he for...in loop iterates over all enumerable properties of an object, including inherited properties from its prototype chain
